My name is Jonah and I am a sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign studying Computer Science. I remembered when I was 11 years old Mr.Jupiter introduced me to basic, an old programming language developed by Microsoft. Since that moment on, I fell in love with computers and started to do some web development projects and joined a computer club in highschool. Now, I am fortunate enough to go to an amazing college that not only intensify my passion for computers but also pushes me to become a better programmer by learning the principles, concepts, and math that drives modern computers and technologies. My interest is not limited by my classes, last semester I joined Projects@ACM doing cool projects in machine learning to predict covid-19 cases.
